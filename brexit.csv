Nicola Sturgeon needs to face reality. No soft #brexit . UK will leave the EU & single market. If Scotland wants that it shld leave the UK
and who was the face of Brexit ? NF I believe and that is who people listen to because they think he has their backs

what is your Brexit plan called ? "Put Scotland in its Place about Europe" ??
Defining populism as antielitism etc is wrong. Brexit /Trump etc are due to fear of groups (immigrants,elites,etc) leading to nationalism.
