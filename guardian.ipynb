      "Brexit Means Brexit review – a political farce with terrifying implications\n",
      "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jun/22/brexit-means-brexit-review-political-farce-terrifying-implications\n",
      "Film-maker Patrick Forbes has been hanging about behind the scenes for the past year, making a documentary about the battle for the heart and soul of Britain. It’s called Brexit Means Brexit (BBC2). Patrick’s not a political journalist; he mainly just watches, and listens. When he does ask a question, it’s almost embarrassingly deferential. “Forgive me for this, I have to ask a boring question,” he says to Boris Johnson, post the general election result, before just about managing to ask Boris if he is going to run against Theresa May. Not a boring question, and I don’t think Laura Kuenssberg needs to worry about her job. But the approach – more poodle puppy than rottweiler – does mean that they come and play with him, say things; a lot of things. “The Daily Mail is an absolute disgrace, they should be ashamed of themselves,” shouts Anna Soubry, after Paul Dacre shouted ENEMIES OF THE PEOPLE on his front page about the judges who ruled that parliament did have a right to debate Brexit. Nicholas Soames agrees. “The most disgraceful, disgusting headline I have read in my life,” he splutters. The grandson of the bronze dude in the square with the pigeon shit on his head then calls Lord Pannick, who represented Gina Miller against the state, “as smooth as a vaselined otter”. “Frankly, they’re just cowards,” Miller says of her critics. “I’m sorry, be a man – because most of them are men. Come and talk to me and find out my motivations. If you don’t have that courage, just shut up.” Jacob Rees-Mogg, one of her critics, and a man, albeit a rather odd one, doesn’t shut up. “People have all sorts of hobbies, some people like yachts,” he says, plucking a random everyday hobby from his hobby bank. “Some people like being litigates. Mrs Miller likes being a litigate.” But when it looks as though the Brexit bill will be passed by parliament anyway, Andrew Bridgen MP breaks into song. “Spread a little happiness,” he sings, very badly in my inexpert opinion. And when Article 50 is triggered, man of the people Rees-Mogg says: “Salve, festa dies, toto venerabilis aevo.” Then he remembers that there may be a few oiks who don’t actually speak Latin and translates: “Hail festal day, venerable through all ages.” Soubry talks more my kind of language. “It’s just a bit shit, isn’t it?” she says, unhappily. Meanwhile, in Stoke, another woman – not a politician, just a normal woman – thinks the leader of Ukip is a bit shit. “How dare Paul Nuttall show his face in this city,” she says. “Racist anti-immigration bastard!” Hear hear. And in sunny Hunstanton, the previous leader of the same party tells an audience of old ’kippers who have actually paid to spend An Evening with Nigel Farage, that he’s not anti European. “I’ve married German women,” he tells them. Ha ha ha. Women? I think we only knew about one, didn’t we? The Other Frau Farage, that’s a story I’d like to read. Guess what, the election that definitely wasn’t going to happen is going to happen. “She’s played a blinder,” says Alan Duncan. “A general election does pull the Conservative party together,” agrees Bridgen. “I think we’ll get a decent working majority,” says Soames. Ha ha ha. To be fair, he does later revise that forecast: “I worry for the PM that this could rebound on her,” he warns. In Broxtowe, Soubry’s constituency, someone urinates on her poster. Now we’re nearly there, or here rather, the present. Polling day and “Boy oh boy oh boy are we going to be hung, drawn and quartered,” says David Dimbleby, actually not about parliament but about his own lot, and the pollsters, if the exit poll is wrong. It’s not. “To put it mildly, it’s gone tits up,” says Soubry, who may have only just hung on to her seat, but she easily wins the show for her straight (and non-Latin) talking. Forbes strings it all together with snippets of popular opera – Mozart, Rossini, Saint Saëns, Rimsky-Korsakov. In fact, he has pretty much turned the events of the past year, since the referendum, into a libretto – a comic, farcical one, opera buffa maybe? (Obviously, I don’t know what I’m talking about here.) Anyway, it is funny, and jolly, and light, tra la la, ha ha ha. Until you think about the consequences of all this and the ending, which looks like being anything but happy. And suddenly it sounds more like Wagner.\n",

      "Ackley Bridge 8pm, Channel 4 Although this series has drawn comparisons to Waterloo Road, the similarities between the Beeb’s grown-up Grange Hill and this culture-clash drama begin and end with the fact that they’re both set in schools. Instead, its frantic pace is more reminiscent of Shameless, with a big dash of soapiness, too. This week, the newly out Nas wants more with teacher Lila, but her dad’s plans derail things. Elsewhere, there’s heartache for Mandy, who calls off her affair with Sadiq. Hannah&nbsp;J&nbsp;Davies Eat Well for Less? 8pm, BBC1 Gregg Wallace and Chris Bavin continue their quest to satisfy the appetite of Britain’s squeezed middle. Tonight, the pair hope to help Nottingham’s Brook family chip away at their monthly food bills. Daughters Rosie and Sophia are more likely to consume a Snickers than a salad, but those sweet-centred palates task mum Janine with preparing contrasting meals for family members. Can Gregg and Chris help Janine engineer meal plans to satisfy all tastes, sweet and savoury? Mark&nbsp;Gibbings-Jones The Met: Policing London 9pm, BBC1 A thrilling opening tonight: a 60mph car chase within the first five minutes, complete with speed bumps and swearing. Elsewhere, a team investigating drug dealers in Newham decides to name them after US states (“The hardest one to spell is Massachusetts”), and a murder squad is still attempting to find a lead after eight months. They know that if a suspect isn’t identified within the first 48 hours, the chances of it being solved falls dramatically … Ali Catterall Brexit Means Brexit 9pm, BBC2 As we went to press, the increasingly bewildered Theresa May remained the lame-duck PM charged with the fiendish task of delivering us from union with mainland Europe. But it’s indicative of the poison the referendum has dripped into the British body politic that it still feels like this game of pass-the-parcel has a way to run. Patrick Forbes’s film tracks one year since the fateful vote, the consequences of which have been unpredictable and disturbing. Phil Harrison Fargo 10pm, Channel 4 This enduring crime thriller continues to delight as much for its stylised conceits as its dramatic intrigue: this week, Prokofiev’s Peter and the Wolf plays a starring role on the soundtrack. Ray engages in a bit of confidence trickery to extract money from his brother’s account, taking advantage of Ewan McGregor’s resemblance to himself, while David Thewlis’s dentally challenged VM drops in at Emmit’s for dinner and imposes a financial offer on him. David Stubbs The Secrets of Sleep 10pm, More4 If you’re interested in this, you’ll likely have seen Michael Mosley’s recent investigation into kip, in which he revealed just how common sleep deprivation really is. No wonder that this new series might be thought a goer; how, it will ask, can something so universal and soothing be so tough? In this first episode, we meet 20-year-old Izzy, who resists sleep to avoid nightmares. Can the team of experts help her and her fellow troubled sleepers get a decent night? John Robinson A Plastic Whale 9pm, Sky Atlantic It was about as stark and heartbreaking an illustration of the effects of pollution in our oceans as might have been imagined. Earlier this year, a Cuvier’s beaked whale was found dying off Norway; an examination of its corpse retrieved 30 plastic bags from its stomach. Part of the Sky Ocean Rescue campaign, this affecting film tells the story of the stricken creature – and, more hearteningly, of the massive cleanup campaign that its tragic death inspired. Andrew Mueller Film choice The Way Back (Peter Weir, 2010) 6.25pm, Film4 An epic story of seven men’s escape from a remote Russian wartime gulag and subsequent 4,000-mile trek across Siberia: a desperate march across wolf-haunted, frozen forest, mountain and desert. Among the hunted are Jim Sturgess’s Polish officer, Ed Harris’s enigmatic American and Colin Farrell’s violent convict; plus there’s an affecting turn by Saoirse Ronan as a village girl. Donnie Brasco (Mike Newell, 1997) 10.55pm, Movies4Men Johnny Depp stars as FBI man Joe Pistone, on whose real-life memoirs Newell’s suspenseful thriller is based. Infiltrating the mob posing as low-level hood Donnie Brasco, he is unwittingly abetted by the oddly shrewish gangster and father figure Lefty Ruggiero (Al Pacino), who takes him under his wing. It’s a grim, downbeat portrait of mafia life: these mobsters are hard, but as tacky as their 70s suits. Paul Howlett Live sport Tennis: Queen’s 1.10pm, BBC2.

      "Excellently written and compelling argument by Vince Cable (Progressive MPs must fight Corbyn’s hard line on the EU, 28 July) but, if he wants more of us Jeremy supporters to join him, he should stop describing the far left as being in a “time warp”. I, for example, have six progressive grandchildren, my own company, and I teach leadership and management in world-class business schools. If Vince spent more time reminding people that only 24% of the British people voted to leave, he might get more support from the likes of me. But let me help him with a simple solution on Brexit – ask our European partners to also leave the EU and then, after some important changes, relaunch as the European Association one month later.

      "Brexit breaks breakfast? Hard Brexit could mean hard luck for fry-up fans\n",
      "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/10/hard-brexit-english-breakfast-hard-luck-fry-up-fans\n",
      "Shoppers would be forced to pay £3 more for a traditional British fry-up if the government fails to secure a trade deal with the EU, piling more pressure on already cash-strapped consumers. A typical basket of ingredients for a family breakfast could rise by almost 13% from £23.59 to £26.61 according to a report by KPMG. The accountancy firm warned households would face above-inflation price rises for imported breakfast classics such as olive oil, bacon and orange juice if Britain left the EU without a deal and defaulted to the World Trade Organisation’s (WTO) customs rules. It estimated that a 79p litre of orange juice from Spain and bottled in Ireland would rise to 93p, and a 300g pack of Danish bacon would increase from £2 to £2.18. In other examples a litre of Italian olive oil would jump from £3.60 to £4.68. A 500g pack of French butter would rise by a quarter to £4.08. Butter prices are already at an all-time high, up 20% over the past 12 months, as farmers and dairies struggle to cope with demand. Consumer budgets are under mounting pressure as the sharp fall in sterling’s valuesince the Brexit vote last year pushes up the prices of goods imported from abroad and drives shop prices higher. The pound is currently trading at about $1.29, 13% lower than it was on the day of the June 2016 referendum. As a result, inflation has risen rapidly, from 0.3% in May last year to a four-year high of 2.9% in May this year. Meanwhile wage growth is weak, intensifying the squeeze on household finances. “WTO tariffs could have a significant impact on both consumers and retailers alike – totting up consumer price tags and further squeezing retail margins,” said Bob Jones, director at the accountancy firm. “It’s important to remember that our analysis does not even reflect the steep costs consumers and retailers are already facing as a result of the pound sterling’s devaluation or the costs of any new non-tariff barriers.” KPMG said that if no deal was struck on or before March 2019, two years after the UK triggered article 50, imported food and drink items would be among those hardest hit by increased tariffs. “If the UK leaves the EU without a trade deal or transitional agreement, we can expect both higher prices and a huge spike in red tape at the borders,” Jones said. “The top priority for businesses is to fully understand their own supply chains: the volumes and values of the goods they ship back and forth and which countries they’re importing to and from.” KPMG made the calculations by taking the cost of mid-range ingredients of a fry-up from a UK supermarket and applying the current EU external customs tariffs to each product. It also took into account the grocer’s price mark-up. Milk, free range eggs and sliced white bread were all sourced from the UK in the analysis, and were therefore free from additional tariffs. Paul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG, said that while supermarkets had so far avoided fully passing on higher prices to customers, this would change if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. “The British consumer has become accustomed to seasonal produce all year round and has binged on a diet of discounts for some time. “Shoppers could be forgiven for overlooking the significant impact customs will have on the prices they pay at the till. However, against a backdrop of increasingly squeezed margins, it is unlikely retailers will be able to hold the flood on higher costs indefinitely.” Last week Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, said Britain has more to lose than the EU if it walked away without a deal. “In practice, ‘no deal’ would worsen the ‘lose-lose’ situation which is bound to result from Brexit. And the UK would have more to lose than its partners,” Barnier said.\n",
      "Divisions exposed over £66bn Brexit divorce bill\n",
      "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jul/18/eu-talks-divided-over-britains-brexit-divorce-bill-mooted-at-66bn\n",
      "Divisions over the UK’s Brexit divorce bill were laid bare on Tuesday as British negotiators pushed back against a mooted €75bn (£66bn) Brexit charge. On the second day of detailed Brexit negotiations, the British team peppered the Brussels side with questions over how to pay for unwinding 44 years of the UK’s European Union membership. An earlier session of talks on Monday was so intense officials did not take a coffee break and were running out of water. Both sides think the mood has improved after the British government admitted last week it had debts to the EU. A statement to parliament on Thursday that the UK has financial “obligations” from its EU membership helped defuse a potentially toxic row that was brewing, after the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, said Brussels should “go whistle” for the money. Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, has never put a number on the UK’s exit bill, but estimates have ranged from a €20bn-€100bn gross figure – the €100bn is a gross figure that works out at about €75bn net. Barnier has told his staff not to talk numbers, the Guardian understands. EU negotiators think the British government will find it easier to sell the divorce bill to the public by presenting it as the price for a future relationship, according to people close to the talks. Barnier will not try to pin the British down to a number, when he reports back to EU leaders on whether the British have made “sufficient progress” at a Brussels summit in October. The final Brexit bill is unlikely to emerge until the last hours of negotiations. Seasoned Brussels negotiators think a deal is most likely to emerge at a late-night summit of EU leaders in the autumn of 2018. As the talks wound up on Tuesday, some media reported that a “Brussels paper” put the Brexit bill at €70bn. Sources familiar with the negotiations said it was not drawn up by Barnier’s team and had no status in the talks. Although the British have acknowledged they have debts through 44 years of EU membership, the government has not spelled out what those liabilities are. Neither has the British government published a formal negotiating document on the divorce bill. But British officials are frustrated at portrayals that they are unprepared. The UK thinks this frequently aired charge does not do justice to the year-long technical preparations at the Department for Exiting the EU (DexEU) and the Treasury. Negotiators discussed Northern Ireland for several hours on Tuesday morning in a special set of talks led by the EU’s Sabine Weyand and DexEU’s Olly Robbins. British officials described at length their view on the Good Friday agreement and the common travel area. Both sides say this current round of negotiations is about deepening understanding of the other’s position rather than striking deals. Three rounds of Brexit talks are scheduled for August, September and October, before an EU summit in late October, when EU leaders will decide whether the UK has made “sufficient progress” on divorce issues. Only then will the UK be allowed to progress to trade talks. A European commission spokesman defended David Davis after the Brexit secretary was criticised for spending less than an hour in Brussels to launch the talks on Monday. “Chief negotiators do not have to be present all the time. These are well-structured talks over a week, so work is ongoing and we do not feel concerned about this,” said the commission’s chief spokesman.\n",
      "Carry on glamping: Brexit boosts staycations\n",
      "https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2017/jul/13/glamping-brexit-staycation-domestic-tourism-british-campsites\n",
      "Standing among the fells, overlooking the idyllic Ullswater, The Quiet Site is located in what is arguably one of the Lake District’s most prime positions. Here, in the early evening after a scorching June day, families have returned from exploring the majestic surroundings. Parents with beers in hand are setting up barbecues, while children play outside the tents and huts. Owner Daniel Holder gives me a tour of the site he bought from his mother 14 years ago. “It’s not like work at all,” he tells me. Our chat is punctuated by small talk with his guests. “I love the variety. I enjoy the relationship with staff members. I enjoy the buzz.” Holder is even enthusiastic about about his site’s water recycling system and solar panels. Since Holder took over from his mother, the campsite has expanded from 60 to 100 pitches, and features profitable glamping options, such as bell tents, pods and hobbit holes. The hobbit holes are the most expensive choice. They have space for two adults and four children and include a heater, lights, plugs, USB charging sockets, a small toilet and basin. Tent pitches start at £16 per night, while the hobbit holes are £95. There are also two cottages on site. “We jumped into glamping at an early stage,” says Holder. “We wanted to make the focus about more than just having a nice bar.” To create a more stable income, Holder extended the campsites opening period from eight months a year to all year round. “That made a huge difference to us. It made things more predictable, and you can retain good staff.” Attracting less seasoned tent dwellers, camping – boosted by glamping options – is enjoying a revival. More than 17m camping and caravanning trips were taken by UK adults in 2016, according to Mintel. This is expected to rise to 17.9 million this year. Brexit, which led to a fall in value of the pound, has influenced the rise in camping trips. “Brexit has boosted the staycation, with booking growth for domestic holidays rising from 34% to 46%,” says Dan Yates, founder of online campsite and holiday parking website Pitchup. “Our sector is certainly benefiting from Brexit – more than other sectors of the tourism industry – as we appeal to savvy, budget-conscious travellers who are always looking for ways to make their holiday spend go further.” Tim and Eva Johnson were living in Brighton before they decided to take over Blackberry Wood in Sussex and become one of the nearly 5,000 campsites and caravan sites in Britain – as of April 2016, there were an estimated 4,738 campsites in the country, according to VisitEngland (for England) and lovecamping.co.uk (for Wales and Scotland). “We were ready to start a family, but also wanted to work for ourselves and do something together so that we could be around our kids as they were growing up,” says Eva Johnson. “We already had an old caravan on the site so we knew the place well and loved spending time there. So when there was an opportunity to purchase the site, we jumped at the idea. It’s such a wonderful place to bring up children.” However, a life dedicated to camping hasn’t been smooth sailing for the Johnsons. “The first few years we could not make a living from the site but were relying on other income as well. Now we make enough to employ a couple to help us out and to draw a salary, but most of the profit gets ploughed back into the business.” Campsite owners can generally earn anything from £3,000 a year for a basic campsite to millions of pounds if it features a large number of pitches and glamping options. Over the years campsite owners have diversified to boost their earning potential. “Campsites have to work to increase the cost per stay for each booking on their site,” says Rob Ganley, senior communications manager at The Camping and Caravanning Club. “Easy ways to do this are to develop more hard standing [where a material, such as recycled plastic mesh, is fitted on a pitch to make it suitable for parking a caravan or motorhome] and full-service pitches, and of course provide more glamping and self-catering options on larger campsites.” Recent, more novel, services seen on campsites include pizza delivery, beauty treatments, “adopt a hen” and bushcraft skills, says Yates. However, for the owners, it’s not as easy as dropping off some pizzas. “As we have been learning on the job, we have constantly had to think on the spot and we still, after almost 14 years, encounter something new pretty much every week,” says Eva Johnson. “The biggest challenge has probably been balancing home life with work, especially when our children [the couple have three] were very young ... We live on site and run the reception from our kitchen most of the time, so it can be pretty invasive and you never really have time off unless you physically remove yourself from the site.” With 30 pitches of varying shapes and sizes all laid out in a crook shape around a communal playing field, the appeal of Batcombe Vale campsite in Somerset is also its greatest challenge, says co-owner Andrew Curtis. “It is quite remote, meaning our only mains supply is electricity. Our water is drawn from our own private borehole, which creates its own challenges and we use LPG [liquefied petroleum gas] boilers to heat the water for the campsite.” The other major issue is the size of people’s tents, he adds. “They have grown exponentially while our pitches have stayed the same.” For those toying with the idea of launching a campsite, Ganley advises planning ahead before building hard standings, drinking-water facilities or waste-disposal points. When assessing a plot of land for use as a campsite first consider how easy it is to access, if it has a good approach route, and whether it has at least half an acre of fairly level ground. As for the future, there’s no resting for Holder, who admits he’s not so keen on holidays himself. Expansion is always on his mind, whether by acquiring other sites or travelling abroad to seek inspiration for luxury facilities he could bring to the Lakes. That’s when he’s not walking around the campsite, torch in hand, checking on the noise situation. This article was amended on 19 July, 2017 to clarify quotations.

      "Democratic challenges to the Brexit decision | Letters\n",
      "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/29/democratic-challenges-to-the-brexit-decision\n",
      "Brexit devotees hold dearly to their slim majority and assert “democracy” in demanding this grave national error go unchallenged. But the real democrats are Carole Cadwalladr (The great British Brexit robbery, Observer, 23 June) and George Monbiot (Who paid for the leave vote…, 28 June) in questioning the very legitimacy of the 2016 EU referendum. David Cameron’s unforgivable legacy was to agree the EU membership vote. By comparison, we don’t hold public votes on judicial decisions; we rely on experienced judges to chart the way through trials with dedicated analysis of the detail by objective juries. This is strictly governed to heavily punish any financial interference. The EU referendum met no comparable standard, nor would another. So Monbiot’s petition to challenge the legitimacy of the Brexit vote should be supported by democrats everywhere. But a repeat vote is a bad idea. Current talks ensure the slim desire to consider an exit by the jury of public opinion is satiated. But parliament must have the final judicial say. On&nbsp;seeing the harsh reality of a nationally calamitous Brexit, any MP must conclude that leaving amounts to societal vandalism and must be stopped. They will just need the vision and the guts to say so. Nick Mayer Southampton • At last someone has voiced “the concept that dare not speak its name” (What if the will of the people is now for a second referendum on Brexit?, theguardian.com, 28 June). It is now clear that during the referendum campaign we were in an era of “pre-truth” and that, today, facts about the disentanglement from Europe require little exposition, exposing the whole thing as&nbsp;a ludicrously costly and self-harming mess. Further, the general election proved that the youth of the UK are prepared to rise from their beds to vote for a cause in which they believe, and there can be little doubt that, if they had roused themselves a year earlier, we would not now be in this turmoil. The first phase of negotiations has not only thrown into clarity the unbelievable complexity and cost we face, but that David Davis is (at best) a tenth as clever as he appears to believe. There should be no shame or recalcitrance about accepting that circumstances have changed, the truth is out, and the stupidity of our departure from the EU is writ large. It isn’t as if Theresa May hasn’t changed her mind before – it’s harder to find circumstances in which she hasn’t. It’s blatantly obvious that there should be a second vote, now we all know what the ramifications of exit actually are. Peter Empringham Bristol • Larry Elliott (Analysis, 26 June) is absolutely right when he says that many measures in Labour’s recent manifesto, such as increased state aid, would be “harder to implement, or actually prohibited, inside the EU”. If&nbsp;that simple fact were more widely understood there would be a better chance for a meeting of minds between those who voted remain and those who voted leave. Labour’s manifesto relies on the opportunities available in leaving the EU and we need more debate about these topics. Kate Brown London • I fully agree with the critics of Theresa May’s offer to EU citizens in the UK (Report, 28 June). However, the debate over their rights post-Brexit seems to solely focus on formulating a snapshot of rights and entitlements, instead of considering EU citizenship in terms of future possibilities. As a Hungarian immigrant living in the UK, I found that the greatest value of being an EU citizen was to be able to imagine a mobile future: not having to settle, not having to abide by rigidly defined legal statuses of “resident” or “national”, not having to make an imminent decision about whether I wanted to stay in, leave, or return to the UK. While I deeply appreciate all those who have spoken up for the rights of EU citizens, I find it important to recognise that the freedom of movement is working towards an international form of solidarity not only through guaranteeing certain rights, but also by construing a broader field of possibilities for EU and UK nationals alike. Thu Thuy Phan Glasgow • I was heartened by your editorial (Brexit is not the answer) and Jonathan Freedland’s piece (Can Brexit be stopped?) on 24 June. I was also heartened by Donald Tusk’s and Emmanuel Macron’s remarks encouraging the UK to think again. In the referendum I voted remain but with a private subtext “and reform the EU”. And I suggest that therein lies the key. The leave campaign slogan “take back control” resonated with many people. All over Europe, not just in the UK, there are movements pressing for powers to be devolved away from Brussels whenever possible. It’s most certainly not too late to realise that Brexit is not the answer: if the EU were to show willing to devolve more authority from Brussels to EU members, it would surely help tip the balance of the national perception of the whole matter.

      "How do citizens' rights affect Brexit negotiations?\n",
      "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/19/how-do-citizens-rights-affect-brexit-negotiations\n",
      "What are citizens’ rights and why are they important? Citizens’ rights are the rights and protections offered to all EU citizens, including free movement and residence, equal treatment and a wide range of other rights under EU law regarding work, education, social security and health. They are held by some 3.5 million citizens from other member states in the UK and about 1.2 million British nationals on the continent, and are a key part of the article 50 negotiations that are taking Britain out of Europe. For Brussels, citizens’ rights are “the first priority” of the article 50 divorce talks. “We need real guarantees for our people who live, work and study in the UK, and the same goes for Brits,” the European council’s president, Donald Tusk, has said. The UK government likewise stressed in its Brexit white paper that it wants to “give people the certainty they want ... at the earliest opportunity. It is the right and fair thing to do”. In the opening session of article 50 talks on 19 June, the two sides confirmed they would prioritise the question of citizens’ rights, on which Brexit secretary David Davis said there was “much common ground”. How did things stand before talks began? Agreeing a problem needs urgent resolution is not the same as agreeing on the answer. Citizens’ rights are a far more complex area than many in Whitehall admit – and could prove a big stumbling block. The issue generated early ill feeling. Claims by Theresa May that she tried to reach an early deal on the issue but was rebuffed by member states drew a sharp EU reminder that the topic could not be addressed outside the formal divorce talks. After a succession of high-profile cases involving longstanding residents or their children being denied permanent residency, the British government has also been accused in Brussels of failing to treat EU nationals fairly and humanely. What is the UK’s position? On 22 June, May travelled to Brussels to unveil the outline of what she called a “fair and serious” offer to guarantee the rights of EU citizens in Britain. On 26 June, she told parliament the details and the government published a 15-page document. The offer would confer on EU nationals who have been living in the UK for five years a new “settled status”, allowing them to be treated like British citizens for residence and entitlement to education, health care, benefits and pensions. The policy paper said the UK was willing to agree to a “cut-off point” between 29 March 2017 – when article 50 was triggered – and Brexit day. All EU nationals in the UK before that date will be able to build up five years’ worth of residence. The UK promised to streamline the application process, drop the requirement for comprehensive health insurance, index-link EU nationals’ pensions and allow them to send welfare payments to children abroad. But the offer still falls short of what the EU expects because it would see EU citizens lose a number of rights they currently have. Several sticking points will have to be resolved before a reciprocal agreement on citizens’ rights can be reached. What is the EU’s position? EU leaders at a summit in Brussels criticised May’s initial outline as “not sufficient”, “vague” and “a first step”, while expats condemned it as “pathetic”. The response to the detailed offer was not much better. Michel Barnier, the bloc’s chief Brexit negotiator, tweeted that its aim was the “same level of protection as in EU law” and that “more ambition, clarity and guarantees” were needed than the UK’s opening position. In a document handed to the UK’s EU ambassador on 12 June, the EU27 demanded “effective, enforceable, non-discriminatory and comprehensive” guarantees “to safeguard the status and rights derived from EU law at the date of withdrawal”. The EU27 wants these rights to apply in perpetuity, not just to EU citizens in the UK and British citizens on the continent now, but to those who lived abroad at any time during the UK’s membership of the EU. It also wants those rights to apply to “current and future family members”, no matter their nationality, who decide to join the right-holder after Brexit, and to continue to apply to family members after the divorce or death of the right-holder. So what are the likely sticking points? Start date The UK’s preferred cut-off date is 29 March 2017, when article 50 was triggered, whereas the EU wants it to be the day that Britain formally leaves. Family union EU nationals who marry after March 2019 will lose their right to bring family members to the UK unless they pass the minimum income test required of UK citizens who want to bring in non-EU family members. Students There is no clarity on whether students allowed to finish courses will be able to stay on to work after their studies. Application process EU nationals who have already gone through the often torturous and sometimes expensive process of attaining permanent UK residence will have to go through another registration process. Right to leave and come back Unless they meet certain requirements, EU nationals with settled status in the UK risk losing it – and therefore their right to return – if they leave Britain for more than two years. Two classes of EU citizen The UK suggests that unlike those who arrive before the yet-to-be-agreed cutoff date, EU nationals who arrive after it may stay for a “temporary period” but “should have no expectation of guaranteed settled status.” Voting rights The UK proposal makes no mention of whether EU nationals with settled status will be able to vote in local elections. Enforcement The UK insists British courts must enforce the agreement in the UK, while the EU wants the European commission to monitor it and the European Court of Justice – or an equivalent body following ECJ rules – to enforce it. The UK has repeatedly said Brexit must mean leaving the jurisdiction of the ECJ.\n",
      "Andrew Rawnsley’s A to Z of Brexit\n",
      "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/24/a-to-z-of-brexit-andrew-rawnsley\n",
      "A IS FOR ASTRONAUTS Space, the final frontier. As a contingency against Brexit going horribly wrong, the government hopes to go where no government has gone before and seek out new worlds and new civilisations. Ministers will be presenting a space industry bill giving them the power to license spaceplanes and spaceports. So if he fails to secure the frictionless borders with the EU that he seeks, Liam Fox can try his luck negotiating free trade agreements with extraterrestrials. B IS FOR BORIS JOHNSON Once and likely future pretender to the Tory crown whose denials of interest in Mrs May’s tottering throne are strangely disbelieved by everyone. Some Boris-backers in his party argue that their next leader needs to be a Tory who campaigned for Brexit in order to persuade the Conservative party to swallow a less stark version of withdrawal which prioritises protecting the economy. Johnsonphobes say no one in Europe takes him seriously. They also point to a shambolic turn on the BBC last week. Under interrogation by the excellent Eddie Mair of Radio 4’s PM programme, the foreign secretary registered a 10 on the internationally recognised Abbott scale of car crash interviews. C IS FOR CITIZENS’ RIGHTS The future status of EU citizens in Britain and Brits living in the EU27 is a crucial zone of contention in the opening skirmishes of the negotiations. Mrs May made what she called a “bold and generous offer”. The commission sniffed that it was “insufficient”. Behind the posturing, both sides agree on the imperative to reach an agreement granting reciprocally recognised rights to the millions affected. That doesn’t mean getting there will be easy. D IS FOR DEEP (AND SPECIAL) RELATIONSHIP What the government says it wants with the EU after the break-up. Darling, it’s me, not you. What the prime minister also suggested that she had with the Democratic Unionist party until it began bargaining over the price of its support in Westminster. The 10 Unionist MPs will be critical in keeping the Tory minority government on the road and in knife-edge, Brexit-related votes in the Commons. The Unionists are already fuming that the Tories are taking them for granted; the Tories are already harrumphing that the DUP is too greedy. This is a pointer to just how vulnerable the government will be in parliament where it will be at risk of ambush and defeat at each stage of the Brexit process by combinations of Tory rebels, opposition parties (see Holyrood and Jeremy Corbyn) and stroppy peers (see Lords). E IS FOR EMERGENCY BRAKE An idea for curbing immigration that David Cameron used in his doomed attempt to make the EU more palatable to swing voters. The UK would be granted some power to curb surges of immigration while still retaining effective membership of the single market. Some Labour people have promoted an alternative notion: migration to be restricted to those who have a job offer in Britain. The EU might regard this as an example of Britain trying to “have its cake and eat it” (See Boris). F IS FOR FIGHT OF THE SUMMER This is what David Davis, the Brexit secretary, had been promising us. Before last week’s opening of the formal bargaining, he predicted that the first clash would come over the EU’s refusal to talk about trade until there had been sufficient progress on the UK’s payment for its outstanding budget obligations. The negotations began with an immediate capitulation by the British side on this sequencing question, a retreat which underlined a brute fact about the relative strength of the two sides. The UK needs a deal more than the EU needs a deal. G IS FOR GREAT REPEAL BILL The main piece of eight Brexit-related items of legislation which the government hopes to get through parliament. The “Great” now appears to have been dropped from the bill’s title. It was always a misnomer. The legislation will repeal the European Communities Act of 1972 which took Britain into the then Common Market, while also translating all EU law into British law so that it can be kept, amended or scrubbed at later leisure. This legislation will present a host of opportunities for the government’s opponents to make trouble for ministers. H IS FOR HOLYROOD Home of the Scottish parliament and another potential spanner in the Brexit works. Under the Sewel convention, some elements of Brexit legislation may require Holyrood’s approval. Scottish Nationalists think that the Edinburgh parliament has a veto and threaten to wield it if control of areas such as fisheries and farming are not devolved. Lawyers have advised ministers that it is not yet clear if this is the case. Nor do they seem sure what happens if Holyrood says no. I IS FOR IRISH BORDER Another key challenge for early stages of the negotiations. Everyone agrees that it will be undesirable to have a “hard border” between Northern Ireland and the Republic. This is a big concern for the Tories’ partners in the DUP. What no one seems to have satisfactorily settled yet is how that aim can be made compatible with the government’s current version of Brexit which involves leaving the customs union. J IS FOR JEREMY CORBYN With a minority Tory government embarked on such a momentous and fraught endeavour, the role of the opposition will be pivotal. Labour’s ambiguity about crucial aspects of Brexit served it well during the election, when it managed to attract support from both Remain and Leave voters. This unstable coalition will be tested by the fierce debates to come. Some Labour people suggest that they would be willing to co-operate in trying to make a success of Brexit if the Tories moderated their position. The signs from the Labour leadership are that they aren’t interested in any collaboration and would rather try to hang “Tory Brexit” around the government’s neck. K IS FOR KAMIKAZE SCENARIO The result of no divorce agreement. The UK would be released from all EU treaties. It would also have nothing to replace the thousands of international deals that flow from them. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, calls this a “very, very bad outcome”. Severe and widescale disruption would hit businesses and consumers as tariffs are imposed and trade gums up at borders. L IS FOR LORDS Most peers are hostile to harder versions of Brexit and the government has no majority in the upper house. Under the Salisbury convention, peers will not resist a government when it is implementing manifesto policies. The failure of the Tories to win a Commons majority makes it moot whether that applies. M IS FOR MAY, MRS In old Tory use, synonym for the new Iron Lady, Gloriana, Boudicca and strong ’n’ stable. Rapidly redefined since she misplaced their majority at the election. In new Tory use, synonym for mayhem, walking dead, lame duck and weak ’n’ wobbly. N IS FOR NORWAY OPTION Old idea given new life by the election result. In this soft version of Brexit, Britain repatriates some powersfrom Brussels, but retains membership of the European Economic Area and remains within the single market for most intents and purposes. The Cityand many businesses would like this, but it would require a continuing financial contribution to the EU and the acceptance of most of its rules. O IS FOR OPEN BREXIT Favoured by the Tory leader in Scotland, Ruth Davidson. Another way of saying Soft Brexit. Just as Clean Brexit is really just another way of saying Hard Brexit. See also A Red, White and Blue Brexit (T May), A Workers’ Brexit (J Corbyn) and A Dog’s Brexit (I’ve just made that up). P IS FOR PAYING UP Divorce is usually expensive. Estimates of what the EU wants by way of a separation payment rise to a net tab of €75bn (£65.6bn). Ministers insist they will not cough up that sum, but have not said what they might agree to. Just one cent will enrage some Tories. Q IS FOR QUEEN’S SPEECH A budget version this year, with cut-down pomp – rather appropriate in the reduced circumstances in which the government finds itself. There won’t be a Queen’s speech at all next year on the grounds that the government needs an unusual double parliamentary session to get all the Brexit legislation through. R IS FOR RASPBERRIES and other soft fruits, which will cost up to 50% more after Brexit if tighter immigration controls prevent seasonal workers coming into Britain to pick the produce. So warns British Summer Fruits, the industry body. Stand by for complaints about the price of strawberries and cream when Brexit angst hits Wimbledon. S IS FOR SABOTEURS Abusive term of choice in the Brextremist press to attack anyone with the temerity to mention the disadvantages of hard Brexit. Mrs May’s election gambit was hailed as an opportunity to “crush the saboteurs”. That went well, didn’t it? T IS FOR TRANSITIONAL ARRANGEMENT Regarded by the Treasury and many others as vital in order to minimise the economic disruption of Brexit, this would mean that Britain only slowly extricated itself from many aspects of the EU. Transitional arrangements can turn into permanent ones, which is why the notion is viewed with narrow-eyed suspicion by many hard Brexiters. U IS FOR UKIP The plum-and-custard brigade were obliterated at the election, but Ukip could revive on the back of voters angered by a diluted, delayed or ditched Brexit. Nigel Farage has hinted that he might be up for a third tour – or would that be fourth? V IS FOR VOTERS Bloody voters. The electorate is ultimately to blame for casting Britain adrift in an ocean of uncertainty. Voters narrowly chose to instruct politicians to take Britain out of the EU in the 2016 referendum. Then the country declined to give Mrs May a mandate to pursue her type of Brexit while producing a parliament without any clear consensus for any other version. Bloody voters. W IS FOR WORLD TRADE ORGANISATION In the event of Britain departing with no deal on trade, we would default to the rules set by the World Trade Organisation. Hard Brexiters argue that this would not be so terrible. Many businesses say it would mean a nightmare as tariffs and non-tariff barriers were erected between UK and EU trade. X IS FOR KISSES still being blown across the Channel from some on the continent. Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, recently voiced the hope that Britain might change its mind. The election result has emboldened some British Remainers to believe the battle is not over yet. Breversal would require a decisive shift in public opinion and a government willing to hold a second referendum and able to win it in order to overturn the result of the first. Y IS FOR YOUTH The pro-Remain young were overwhelmed by the pro-Leave old in the referendum. Many&nbsp;young voters have said that their anger animated them to seek their revenge on the Tories in the recent election. What goes around comes around. Z IS FOR ZERO HOUR That would be 29 March 2019, when the UK is scheduled to leave the EU, deal or no deal. If there is an agreement, it will need to be wrapped up by the end of 2018 to leave time for approval by EU states and the European parliament. An extension is possible, but would require the unanimous consent of the EU 27. Time is not Britain’s friend. So thank goodness we have such a strong and stable government.\n",
      "‘Back soft Brexit,’ unions urge Labour\n",
      "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/24/labour-told-by-unions-back-soft-brexit\n",
      "Jeremy Corbyn was under pressure from across the labour movement last night to support a softer form of Brexit as the TUC joined senior party figures in calling for Britain to retain the option of staying in the single market. The unions’ intervention followed a call from Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Brexit select committee, who wants the party leadership to shift position and support staying in the customs union rather than rejecting the possibility outright. Last week, 50 senior Labour MPs, peers and MEPs, including the former shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna, signed a statement saying the best way to respect the wishes of the pro-Remainers who voted for Labour on 8 June was to “fight unambiguously for membership of the single market”. Both Corbyn and the shadow chancellor John McDonnell have thus far stopped short of explicitly insisting upon membership of the single market and customs union, stressing instead that whatever deal is done must ensure that the UK continues to enjoy the full benefits of both. However, after the general election, there is a growing view in Labour, and sections of the Tory party, that the government lacks a mandate for a hard Brexit, and that such as an approach is not backed by a majority of MPs, who fear dire economic consequences of such a complete break. Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the TUC ,is known to back single market membership. She tweeted earlier this year: “If we leave the single market, working people will end up paying the price. It’d be bad for jobs, for work rights &amp; for our living standards.” On Saturday, a statement from the TUC said that Britain “needs a Brexit that works for working people” and insisted it was a “mistake” for Theresa May to rule out membership of the single market. “That risks people’s jobs and their hard-won rights at work. At the very least, the Brexit deal must allow tariff-free and barrier-free trade with Europe. And written into the deal there must be an ongoing level playing field on workers’ rights between the UK and the EU.” Labour MPs expect that unions such as the GMB may also pressure Corbyn to shift ground in the run up to the party conference in the autumn. With bills on Brexit dominating last week’s Queen’s speech, the battle over the terms of the UK withdrawal from the EU is about to begin in earnest in parliament. Increasingly, pro-EU MPs in both Labour and Tory ranks are urging their leaders to modify their positions to ensure the economic damage is as limited as possible. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme Benn said maintaining tariff-free trade was essential to the future of the British economy and urged Corbyn to move. “The simplest way to do that is to remain in the customs union,” he said. From the Tory side, the former minister Nicky Morgan – who is campaigning to become the chairwoman of the powerful Treasury select committee – said it was “very disappointing” that May had decided to “turn her back completely on the single market and the customs union”. She said there was a growing view across parliament that membership of the customs union, at least, had to be kept on the table in Brexit negotiations. An early test of cross-party cooperation among those MPs who are opposed to a hard Brexit will come this week when the Liberal Democrats put down an amendment to the Queen’s speech calling for Britain to stay in both the single market and customs union. The Lib Dems say they have opened talks with MPs from other parties. Alistair Carmichael, the party’s chief whip, said: “Many people, including those who voted Leave, are increasingly worried about what Brexit will mean for our economy and living standards. “We’re now staring over the precipice at the economic reality of an extreme Brexit. Future generations won’t forgive us if we fail to act.” On Sunday the government will pledge to keep duty-free access to UK markets for the world’s poorest 48 countries across the globe, including Bangladesh, Haiti, Ethiopia and Sierra Leone. They will continue to benefit from duty-free exports into the UK for all goods other than weapons, known as the “everything but arms” EU initiative.\n"

       "    'fields': {'bodyText': 'Film-maker Patrick Forbes has been hanging about behind the scenes for the past year, making a documentary about the battle for the heart and soul of Britain. It’s called Brexit Means Brexit (BBC2). Patrick’s not a political journalist; he mainly just watches, and listens. When he does ask a question, it’s almost embarrassingly deferential. “Forgive me for this, I have to ask a boring question,” he says to Boris Johnson, post the general election result, before just about managing to ask Boris if he is going to run against Theresa May. Not a boring question, and I don’t think Laura Kuenssberg needs to worry about her job. But the approach – more poodle puppy than rottweiler – does mean that they come and play with him, say things; a lot of things. “The Daily Mail is an absolute disgrace, they should be ashamed of themselves,” shouts Anna Soubry, after Paul Dacre shouted ENEMIES OF THE PEOPLE on his front page about the judges who ruled that parliament did have a right to debate Brexit. Nicholas Soames agrees. “The most disgraceful, disgusting headline I have read in my life,” he splutters. The grandson of the bronze dude in the square with the pigeon shit on his head then calls Lord Pannick, who represented Gina Miller against the state, “as smooth as a vaselined otter”. “Frankly, they’re just cowards,” Miller says of her critics. “I’m sorry, be a man – because most of them are men. Come and talk to me and find out my motivations. If you don’t have that courage, just shut up.” Jacob Rees-Mogg, one of her critics, and a man, albeit a rather odd one, doesn’t shut up. “People have all sorts of hobbies, some people like yachts,” he says, plucking a random everyday hobby from his hobby bank. “Some people like being litigates. Mrs Miller likes being a litigate.” But when it looks as though the Brexit bill will be passed by parliament anyway, Andrew Bridgen MP breaks into song. “Spread a little happiness,” he sings, very badly in my inexpert opinion. And when Article 50 is triggered, man of the people Rees-Mogg says: “Salve, festa dies, toto venerabilis aevo.” Then he remembers that there may be a few oiks who don’t actually speak Latin and translates: “Hail festal day, venerable through all ages.” Soubry talks more my kind of language. “It’s just a bit shit, isn’t it?” she says, unhappily. Meanwhile, in Stoke, another woman – not a politician, just a normal woman – thinks the leader of Ukip is a bit shit. “How dare Paul Nuttall show his face in this city,” she says. “Racist anti-immigration bastard!” Hear hear. And in sunny Hunstanton, the previous leader of the same party tells an audience of old ’kippers who have actually paid to spend An Evening with Nigel Farage, that he’s not anti European. “I’ve married German women,” he tells them. Ha ha ha. Women? I think we only knew about one, didn’t we? The Other Frau Farage, that’s a story I’d like to read. Guess what, the election that definitely wasn’t going to happen is going to happen. “She’s played a blinder,” says Alan Duncan. “A general election does pull the Conservative party together,” agrees Bridgen. “I think we’ll get a decent working majority,” says Soames. Ha ha ha. To be fair, he does later revise that forecast: “I worry for the PM that this could rebound on her,” he warns. In Broxtowe, Soubry’s constituency, someone urinates on her poster. Now we’re nearly there, or here rather, the present. Polling day and “Boy oh boy oh boy are we going to be hung, drawn and quartered,” says David Dimbleby, actually not about parliament but about his own lot, and the pollsters, if the exit poll is wrong. It’s not. “To put it mildly, it’s gone tits up,” says Soubry, who may have only just hung on to her seat, but she easily wins the show for her straight (and non-Latin) talking. Forbes strings it all together with snippets of popular opera – Mozart, Rossini, Saint Saëns, Rimsky-Korsakov. In fact, he has pretty much turned the events of the past year, since the referendum, into a libretto – a comic, farcical one, opera buffa maybe? (Obviously, I don’t know what I’m talking about here.) Anyway, it is funny, and jolly, and light, tra la la, ha ha ha. Until you think about the consequences of all this and the ending, which looks like being anything but happy. And suddenly it sounds more like Wagner.'},\n",

John Robinson A Plastic Whale 9pm, Sky Atlantic It was about as stark and heartbreaking an illustration of the effects of pollution in our oceans as might have been imagined. Earlier this year, a Cuvier’s beaked whale was found dying off Norway; an examination of its corpse retrieved 30 plastic bags from its stomach.

       "    'fields': {'bodyText': 'Shoppers would be forced to pay £3 more for a traditional British fry-up if the government fails to secure a trade deal with the EU, piling more pressure on already cash-strapped consumers. A typical basket of ingredients for a family breakfast could rise by almost 13% from £23.59 to £26.61 according to a report by KPMG. The accountancy firm warned households would face above-inflation price rises for imported breakfast classics such as olive oil, bacon and orange juice if Britain left the EU without a deal and defaulted to the World Trade Organisation’s (WTO) customs rules. It estimated that a 79p litre of orange juice from Spain and bottled in Ireland would rise to 93p, and a 300g pack of Danish bacon would increase from £2 to £2.18. In other examples a litre of Italian olive oil would jump from £3.60 to £4.68. A 500g pack of French butter would rise by a quarter to £4.08. Butter prices are already at an all-time high, up 20% over the past 12 months, as farmers and dairies struggle to cope with demand. Consumer budgets are under mounting pressure as the sharp fall in sterling’s valuesince the Brexit vote last year pushes up the prices of goods imported from abroad and drives shop prices higher. The pound is currently trading at about $1.29, 13% lower than it was on the day of the June 2016 referendum. As a result, inflation has risen rapidly, from 0.3% in May last year to a four-year high of 2.9% in May this year. Meanwhile wage growth is weak, intensifying the squeeze on household finances. “WTO tariffs could have a significant impact on both consumers and retailers alike – totting up consumer price tags and further squeezing retail margins,” said Bob Jones, director at the accountancy firm. “It’s important to remember that our analysis does not even reflect the steep costs consumers and retailers are already facing as a result of the pound sterling’s devaluation or the costs of any new non-tariff barriers.” KPMG said that if no deal was struck on or before March 2019, two years after the UK triggered article 50, imported food and drink items would be among those hardest hit by increased tariffs. “If the UK leaves the EU without a trade deal or transitional agreement, we can expect both higher prices and a huge spike in red tape at the borders,” Jones said. “The top priority for businesses is to fully understand their own supply chains: the volumes and values of the goods they ship back and forth and which countries they’re importing to and from.” KPMG made the calculations by taking the cost of mid-range ingredients of a fry-up from a UK supermarket and applying the current EU external customs tariffs to each product. It also took into account the grocer’s price mark-up. Milk, free range eggs and sliced white bread were all sourced from the UK in the analysis, and were therefore free from additional tariffs. Paul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG, said that while supermarkets had so far avoided fully passing on higher prices to customers, this would change if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. “The British consumer has become accustomed to seasonal produce all year round and has binged on a diet of discounts for some time. “Shoppers could be forgiven for overlooking the significant impact customs will have on the prices they pay at the till. However, against a backdrop of increasingly squeezed margins, it is unlikely retailers will be able to hold the flood on higher costs indefinitely.” Last week Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, said Britain has more to lose than the EU if it walked away without a deal. “In practice, ‘no deal’ would worsen the ‘lose-lose’ situation which is bound to result from Brexit. And the UK would have more to lose than its partners,” Barnier said.'},\n",

       "    'fields': {'bodyText': 'Divisions over the UK’s Brexit divorce bill were laid bare on Tuesday as British negotiators pushed back against a mooted €75bn (£66bn) Brexit charge. On the second day of detailed Brexit negotiations, the British team peppered the Brussels side with questions over how to pay for unwinding 44 years of the UK’s European Union membership. An earlier session of talks on Monday was so intense officials did not take a coffee break and were running out of water. Both sides think the mood has improved after the British government admitted last week it had debts to the EU. A statement to parliament on Thursday that the UK has financial “obligations” from its EU membership helped defuse a potentially toxic row that was brewing, after the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, said Brussels should “go whistle” for the money. Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, has never put a number on the UK’s exit bill, but estimates have ranged from a €20bn-€100bn gross figure – the €100bn is a gross figure that works out at about €75bn net. Barnier has told his staff not to talk numbers, the Guardian understands. EU negotiators think the British government will find it easier to sell the divorce bill to the public by presenting it as the price for a future relationship, according to people close to the talks. Barnier will not try to pin the British down to a number, when he reports back to EU leaders on whether the British have made “sufficient progress” at a Brussels summit in October. The final Brexit bill is unlikely to emerge until the last hours of negotiations. Seasoned Brussels negotiators think a deal is most likely to emerge at a late-night summit of EU leaders in the autumn of 2018. As the talks wound up on Tuesday, some media reported that a “Brussels paper” put the Brexit bill at €70bn. Sources familiar with the negotiations said it was not drawn up by Barnier’s team and had no status in the talks. Although the British have acknowledged they have debts through 44 years of EU membership, the government has not spelled out what those liabilities are. Neither has the British government published a formal negotiating document on the divorce bill. But British officials are frustrated at portrayals that they are unprepared. The UK thinks this frequently aired charge does not do justice to the year-long technical preparations at the Department for Exiting the EU (DexEU) and the Treasury. Negotiators discussed Northern Ireland for several hours on Tuesday morning in a special set of talks led by the EU’s Sabine Weyand and DexEU’s Olly Robbins. British officials described at length their view on the Good Friday agreement and the common travel area. Both sides say this current round of negotiations is about deepening understanding of the other’s position rather than striking deals. Three rounds of Brexit talks are scheduled for August, September and October, before an EU summit in late October, when EU leaders will decide whether the UK has made “sufficient progress” on divorce issues. Only then will the UK be allowed to progress to trade talks. A European commission spokesman defended David Davis after the Brexit secretary was criticised for spending less than an hour in Brussels to launch the talks on Monday. “Chief negotiators do not have to be present all the time. These are well-structured talks over a week, so work is ongoing and we do not feel concerned about this,” said the commission’s chief spokesman.'},\n",

       "    'fields': {'bodyText': 'Standing among the fells, overlooking the idyllic Ullswater, The Quiet Site is located in what is arguably one of the Lake District’s most prime positions. Here, in the early evening after a scorching June day, families have returned from exploring the majestic surroundings. Parents with beers in hand are setting up barbecues, while children play outside the tents and huts. Owner Daniel Holder gives me a tour of the site he bought from his mother 14 years ago. “It’s not like work at all,” he tells me. Our chat is punctuated by small talk with his guests. “I love the variety. I enjoy the relationship with staff members. I enjoy the buzz.” Holder is even enthusiastic about about his site’s water recycling system and solar panels. Since Holder took over from his mother, the campsite has expanded from 60 to 100 pitches, and features profitable glamping options, such as bell tents, pods and hobbit holes. The hobbit holes are the most expensive choice. They have space for two adults and four children and include a heater, lights, plugs, USB charging sockets, a small toilet and basin. Tent pitches start at £16 per night, while the hobbit holes are £95. There are also two cottages on site. “We jumped into glamping at an early stage,” says Holder. “We wanted to make the focus about more than just having a nice bar.” To create a more stable income, Holder extended the campsites opening period from eight months a year to all year round. “That made a huge difference to us. It made things more predictable, and you can retain good staff.” Attracting less seasoned tent dwellers, camping – boosted by glamping options – is enjoying a revival. More than 17m camping and caravanning trips were taken by UK adults in 2016, according to Mintel. This is expected to rise to 17.9 million this year. Brexit, which led to a fall in value of the pound, has influenced the rise in camping trips. “Brexit has boosted the staycation, with booking growth for domestic holidays rising from 34% to 46%,” says Dan Yates, founder of online campsite and holiday parking website Pitchup. “Our sector is certainly benefiting from Brexit – more than other sectors of the tourism industry – as we appeal to savvy, budget-conscious travellers who are always looking for ways to make their holiday spend go further.” Tim and Eva Johnson were living in Brighton before they decided to take over Blackberry Wood in Sussex and become one of the nearly 5,000 campsites and caravan sites in Britain – as of April 2016, there were an estimated 4,738 campsites in the country, according to VisitEngland (for England) and lovecamping.co.uk (for Wales and Scotland). “We were ready to start a family, but also wanted to work for ourselves and do something together so that we could be around our kids as they were growing up,” says Eva Johnson. “We already had an old caravan on the site so we knew the place well and loved spending time there. So when there was an opportunity to purchase the site, we jumped at the idea. It’s such a wonderful place to bring up children.” However, a life dedicated to camping hasn’t been smooth sailing for the Johnsons. “The first few years we could not make a living from the site but were relying on other income as well. Now we make enough to employ a couple to help us out and to draw a salary, but most of the profit gets ploughed back into the business.” Campsite owners can generally earn anything from £3,000 a year for a basic campsite to millions of pounds if it features a large number of pitches and glamping options. Over the years campsite owners have diversified to boost their earning potential. “Campsites have to work to increase the cost per stay for each booking on their site,” says Rob Ganley, senior communications manager at The Camping and Caravanning Club. “Easy ways to do this are to develop more hard standing [where a material, such as recycled plastic mesh, is fitted on a pitch to make it suitable for parking a caravan or motorhome] and full-service pitches, and of course provide more glamping and self-catering options on larger campsites.” Recent, more novel, services seen on campsites include pizza delivery, beauty treatments, “adopt a hen” and bushcraft skills, says Yates. However, for the owners, it’s not as easy as dropping off some pizzas. “As we have been learning on the job, we have constantly had to think on the spot and we still, after almost 14 years, encounter something new pretty much every week,” says Eva Johnson. “The biggest challenge has probably been balancing home life with work, especially when our children [the couple have three] were very young ... We live on site and run the reception from our kitchen most of the time, so it can be pretty invasive and you never really have time off unless you physically remove yourself from the site.” With 30 pitches of varying shapes and sizes all laid out in a crook shape around a communal playing field, the appeal of Batcombe Vale campsite in Somerset is also its greatest challenge, says co-owner Andrew Curtis. “It is quite remote, meaning our only mains supply is electricity. Our water is drawn from our own private borehole, which creates its own challenges and we use LPG [liquefied petroleum gas] boilers to heat the water for the campsite.” The other major issue is the size of people’s tents, he adds. “They have grown exponentially while our pitches have stayed the same.” For those toying with the idea of launching a campsite, Ganley advises planning ahead before building hard standings, drinking-water facilities or waste-disposal points. When assessing a plot of land for use as a campsite first consider how easy it is to access, if it has a good approach route, and whether it has at least half an acre of fairly level ground. As for the future, there’s no resting for Holder, who admits he’s not so keen on holidays himself. Expansion is always on his mind, whether by acquiring other sites or travelling abroad to seek inspiration for luxury facilities he could bring to the Lakes. That’s when he’s not walking around the campsite, torch in hand, checking on the noise situation. This article was amended on 19 July, 2017 to clarify quotations.

       "    'fields': {'bodyText': 'Brexit devotees hold dearly to their slim majority and assert “democracy” in demanding this grave national error go unchallenged. But the real democrats are Carole Cadwalladr (The great British Brexit robbery, Observer, 23 June) and George Monbiot (Who paid for the leave vote…, 28 June) in questioning the very legitimacy of the 2016 EU referendum. David Cameron’s unforgivable legacy was to agree the EU membership vote. By comparison, we don’t hold public votes on judicial decisions; we rely on experienced judges to chart the way through trials with dedicated analysis of the detail by objective juries. This is strictly governed to heavily punish any financial interference. The EU referendum met no comparable standard, nor would another. So Monbiot’s petition to challenge the legitimacy of the Brexit vote should be supported by democrats everywhere. But a repeat vote is a bad idea. Current talks ensure the slim desire to consider an exit by the jury of public opinion is satiated. But parliament must have the final judicial say. On&nbsp;seeing the harsh reality of a nationally calamitous Brexit, any MP must conclude that leaving amounts to societal vandalism and must be stopped. They will just need the vision and the guts to say so. Nick Mayer Southampton • At last someone has voiced “the concept that dare not speak its name” (What if the will of the people is now for a second referendum on Brexit?, theguardian.com, 28 June). It is now clear that during the referendum campaign we were in an era of “pre-truth” and that, today, facts about the disentanglement from Europe require little exposition, exposing the whole thing as&nbsp;a ludicrously costly and self-harming mess. Further, the general election proved that the youth of the UK are prepared to rise from their beds to vote for a cause in which they believe, and there can be little doubt that, if they had roused themselves a year earlier, we would not now be in this turmoil. The first phase of negotiations has not only thrown into clarity the unbelievable complexity and cost we face, but that David Davis is (at best) a tenth as clever as he appears to believe. There should be no shame or recalcitrance about accepting that circumstances have changed, the truth is out, and the stupidity of our departure from the EU is writ large. It isn’t as if Theresa May hasn’t changed her mind before – it’s harder to find circumstances in which she hasn’t. It’s blatantly obvious that there should be a second vote, now we all know what the ramifications of exit actually are. Peter Empringham Bristol • Larry Elliott (Analysis, 26 June) is absolutely right when he says that many measures in Labour’s recent manifesto, such as increased state aid, would be “harder to implement, or actually prohibited, inside the EU”. If&nbsp;that simple fact were more widely understood there would be a better chance for a meeting of minds between those who voted remain and those who voted leave. Labour’s manifesto relies on the opportunities available in leaving the EU and we need more debate about these topics. Kate Brown London • I fully agree with the critics of Theresa May’s offer to EU citizens in the UK (Report, 28 June). However, the debate over their rights post-Brexit seems to solely focus on formulating a snapshot of rights and entitlements, instead of considering EU citizenship in terms of future possibilities. As a Hungarian immigrant living in the UK, I found that the greatest value of being an EU citizen was to be able to imagine a mobile future: not having to settle, not having to abide by rigidly defined legal statuses of “resident” or “national”, not having to make an imminent decision about whether I wanted to stay in, leave, or return to the UK. While I deeply appreciate all those who have spoken up for the rights of EU citizens, I find it important to recognise that the freedom of movement is working towards an international form of solidarity not only through guaranteeing certain rights, but also by construing a broader field of possibilities for EU and UK nationals alike. Thu Thuy Phan Glasgow • I was heartened by your editorial (Brexit is not the answer) and Jonathan Freedland’s piece (Can Brexit be stopped?) on 24 June. I was also heartened by Donald Tusk’s and Emmanuel Macron’s remarks encouraging the UK to think again. In the referendum I voted remain but with a private subtext “and reform the EU”. And I suggest that therein lies the key. The leave campaign slogan “take back control” resonated with many people. All over Europe, not just in the UK, there are movements pressing for powers to be devolved away from Brussels whenever possible. It’s most certainly not too late to realise that Brexit is not the answer: if the EU were to show willing to devolve more authority from Brussels to EU members, it would surely help tip the balance of the national perception of the whole matter.

       "    'fields': {'bodyText': 'What are citizens’ rights and why are they important? Citizens’ rights are the rights and protections offered to all EU citizens, including free movement and residence, equal treatment and a wide range of other rights under EU law regarding work, education, social security and health. They are held by some 3.5 million citizens from other member states in the UK and about 1.2 million British nationals on the continent, and are a key part of the article 50 negotiations that are taking Britain out of Europe. For Brussels, citizens’ rights are “the first priority” of the article 50 divorce talks. “We need real guarantees for our people who live, work and study in the UK, and the same goes for Brits,” the European council’s president, Donald Tusk, has said. The UK government likewise stressed in its Brexit white paper that it wants to “give people the certainty they want ... at the earliest opportunity. It is the right and fair thing to do”. In the opening session of article 50 talks on 19 June, the two sides confirmed they would prioritise the question of citizens’ rights, on which Brexit secretary David Davis said there was “much common ground”. How did things stand before talks began? Agreeing a problem needs urgent resolution is not the same as agreeing on the answer. Citizens’ rights are a far more complex area than many in Whitehall admit – and could prove a big stumbling block. The issue generated early ill feeling. Claims by Theresa May that she tried to reach an early deal on the issue but was rebuffed by member states drew a sharp EU reminder that the topic could not be addressed outside the formal divorce talks. After a succession of high-profile cases involving longstanding residents or their children being denied permanent residency, the British government has also been accused in Brussels of failing to treat EU nationals fairly and humanely. What is the UK’s position? On 22 June, May travelled to Brussels to unveil the outline of what she called a “fair and serious” offer to guarantee the rights of EU citizens in Britain. On 26 June, she told parliament the details and the government published a 15-page document. The offer would confer on EU nationals who have been living in the UK for five years a new “settled status”, allowing them to be treated like British citizens for residence and entitlement to education, health care, benefits and pensions. The policy paper said the UK was willing to agree to a “cut-off point” between 29 March 2017 – when article 50 was triggered – and Brexit day. All EU nationals in the UK before that date will be able to build up five years’ worth of residence. The UK promised to streamline the application process, drop the requirement for comprehensive health insurance, index-link EU nationals’ pensions and allow them to send welfare payments to children abroad. But the offer still falls short of what the EU expects because it would see EU citizens lose a number of rights they currently have. Several sticking points will have to be resolved before a reciprocal agreement on citizens’ rights can be reached. What is the EU’s position? EU leaders at a summit in Brussels criticised May’s initial outline as “not sufficient”, “vague” and “a first step”, while expats condemned it as “pathetic”. The response to the detailed offer was not much better. Michel Barnier, the bloc’s chief Brexit negotiator, tweeted that its aim was the “same level of protection as in EU law” and that “more ambition, clarity and guarantees” were needed than the UK’s opening position. In a document handed to the UK’s EU ambassador on 12 June, the EU27 demanded “effective, enforceable, non-discriminatory and comprehensive” guarantees “to safeguard the status and rights derived from EU law at the date of withdrawal”. The EU27 wants these rights to apply in perpetuity, not just to EU citizens in the UK and British citizens on the continent now, but to those who lived abroad at any time during the UK’s membership of the EU. It also wants those rights to apply to “current and future family members”, no matter their nationality, who decide to join the right-holder after Brexit, and to continue to apply to family members after the divorce or death of the right-holder. So what are the likely sticking points? Start date The UK’s preferred cut-off date is 29 March 2017, when article 50 was triggered, whereas the EU wants it to be the day that Britain formally leaves. Family union EU nationals who marry after March 2019 will lose their right to bring family members to the UK unless they pass the minimum income test required of UK citizens who want to bring in non-EU family members. Students There is no clarity on whether students allowed to finish courses will be able to stay on to work after their studies. Application process EU nationals who have already gone through the often torturous and sometimes expensive process of attaining permanent UK residence will have to go through another registration process. Right to leave and come back Unless they meet certain requirements, EU nationals with settled status in the UK risk losing it – and therefore their right to return – if they leave Britain for more than two years. Two classes of EU citizen The UK suggests that unlike those who arrive before the yet-to-be-agreed cutoff date, EU nationals who arrive after it may stay for a “temporary period” but “should have no expectation of guaranteed settled status.” Voting rights The UK proposal makes no mention of whether EU nationals with settled status will be able to vote in local elections. Enforcement The UK insists British courts must enforce the agreement in the UK, while the EU wants the European commission to monitor it and the European Court of Justice – or an equivalent body following ECJ rules – to enforce it. The UK has repeatedly said Brexit must mean leaving the jurisdiction of the ECJ.'},\n",

So if he fails to secure the frictionless borders with the EU that he seeks, Liam Fox can try his luck negotiating free trade agreements with extraterrestrials. B IS FOR BORIS JOHNSON Once and likely future pretender to the Tory crown whose denials of interest in Mrs May’s tottering throne are strangely disbelieved by everyone. Some Boris-backers in his party argue that their next leader needs to be a Tory who campaigned for Brexit in order to persuade the Conservative party to swallow a less stark version of withdrawal which prioritises protecting the economy. Johnsonphobes say no one in Europe takes him seriously. They also point to a shambolic turn on the BBC last week. Under interrogation by the excellent Eddie Mair of Radio 4’s PM programme, the foreign secretary registered a 10 on the internationally recognised Abbott scale of car crash interviews. C IS FOR CITIZENS’ RIGHTS The future status of EU citizens in Britain and Brits living in the EU27 is a crucial zone of contention in the opening skirmishes of the negotiations. Mrs May made what she called a “bold and generous offer”. The commission sniffed that it was “insufficient”. Behind the posturing, both sides agree on the imperative to reach an agreement granting reciprocally recognised rights to the millions affected. That doesn’t mean getting there will be easy. D IS FOR DEEP (AND SPECIAL) RELATIONSHIP What the government says it wants with the EU after the break-up. Darling, it’s me, not you. What the prime minister also suggested that she had with the Democratic Unionist party until it began bargaining over the price of its support in Westminster. The 10 Unionist MPs will be critical in keeping the Tory minority government on the road and in knife-edge, Brexit-related votes in the Commons. The Unionists are already fuming that the Tories are taking them for granted; the Tories are already harrumphing that the DUP is too greedy. This is a pointer to just how vulnerable the government will be in parliament where it will be at risk of ambush and defeat at each stage of the Brexit process by combinations of Tory rebels, opposition parties (see Holyrood and Jeremy Corbyn) and stroppy peers (see Lords). E IS FOR EMERGENCY BRAKE An idea for curbing immigration that David Cameron used in his doomed attempt to make the EU more palatable to swing voters. The UK would be granted some power to curb surges of immigration while still retaining effective membership of the single market. Some Labour people have promoted an alternative notion: migration to be restricted to those who have a job offer in Britain. The EU might regard this as an example of Britain trying to “have its cake and eat it” (See Boris). F IS FOR FIGHT OF THE SUMMER This is what David Davis, the Brexit secretary, had been promising us. Before last week’s opening of the formal bargaining, he predicted that the first clash would come over the EU’s refusal to talk about trade until there had been sufficient progress on the UK’s payment for its outstanding budget obligations. The negotations began with an immediate capitulation by the British side on this sequencing question, a retreat which underlined a brute fact about the relative strength of the two sides. The UK needs a deal more than the EU needs a deal. G IS FOR GREAT REPEAL BILL The main piece of eight Brexit-related items of legislation which the government hopes to get through parliament. The “Great” now appears to have been dropped from the bill’s title. It was always a misnomer. The legislation will repeal the European Communities Act of 1972 which took Britain into the then Common Market, while also translating all EU law into British law so that it can be kept, amended or scrubbed at later leisure. This legislation will present a host of opportunities for the government’s opponents to make trouble for ministers. H IS FOR HOLYROOD Home of the Scottish parliament and another potential spanner in the Brexit works. Under the Sewel convention, some elements of Brexit legislation may require Holyrood’s approval. Scottish Nationalists think that the Edinburgh parliament has a veto and threaten to wield it if control of areas such as fisheries and farming are not devolved. Lawyers have advised ministers that it is not yet clear if this is the case. Nor do they seem sure what happens if Holyrood says no. I IS FOR IRISH BORDER Another key challenge for early stages of the negotiations. Everyone agrees that it will be undesirable to have a “hard border” between Northern Ireland and the Republic. This is a big concern for the Tories’ partners in the DUP. What no one seems to have satisfactorily settled yet is how that aim can be made compatible with the government’s current version of Brexit which involves leaving the customs union. J IS FOR JEREMY CORBYN With a minority Tory government embarked on such a momentous and fraught endeavour, the role of the opposition will be pivotal. Labour’s ambiguity about crucial aspects of Brexit served it well during the election, when it managed to attract support from both Remain and Leave voters. This unstable coalition will be tested by the fierce debates to come. Some Labour people suggest that they would be willing to co-operate in trying to make a success of Brexit if the Tories moderated their position. The signs from the Labour leadership are that they aren’t interested in any collaboration and would rather try to hang “Tory Brexit” around the government’s neck. K IS FOR KAMIKAZE SCENARIO The result of no divorce agreement. The UK would be released from all EU treaties. It would also have nothing to replace the thousands of international deals that flow from them. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, calls this a “very, very bad outcome”. Severe and widescale disruption would hit businesses and consumers as tariffs are imposed and trade gums up at borders. L IS FOR LORDS Most peers are hostile to harder versions of Brexit and the government has no majority in the upper house. Under the Salisbury convention, peers will not resist a government when it is implementing manifesto policies. The failure of the Tories to win a Commons majority makes it moot whether that applies. M IS FOR MAY, MRS In old Tory use, synonym for the new Iron Lady, Gloriana, Boudicca and strong ’n’ stable. Rapidly redefined since she misplaced their majority at the election. In new Tory use, synonym for mayhem, walking dead, lame duck and weak ’n’ wobbly. N IS FOR NORWAY OPTION Old idea given new life by the election result. In this soft version of Brexit, Britain repatriates some powersfrom Brussels, but retains membership of the European Economic Area and remains within the single market for most intents and purposes. The Cityand many businesses would like this, but it would require a continuing financial contribution to the EU and the acceptance of most of its rules. O IS FOR OPEN BREXIT Favoured by the Tory leader in Scotland, Ruth Davidson. Another way of saying Soft Brexit. Just as Clean Brexit is really just another way of saying Hard Brexit. See also A Red, White and Blue Brexit (T May), A Workers’ Brexit (J Corbyn) and A Dog’s Brexit (I’ve just made that up). P IS FOR PAYING UP Divorce is usually expensive. Estimates of what the EU wants by way of a separation payment rise to a net tab of €75bn (£65.6bn). Ministers insist they will not cough up that sum, but have not said what they might agree to. Just one cent will enrage some Tories. Q IS FOR QUEEN’S SPEECH A budget version this year, with cut-down pomp – rather appropriate in the reduced circumstances in which the government finds itself. There won’t be a Queen’s speech at all next year on the grounds that the government needs an unusual double parliamentary session to get all the Brexit legislation through. R IS FOR RASPBERRIES and other soft fruits, which will cost up to 50% more after Brexit if tighter immigration controls prevent seasonal workers coming into Britain to pick the produce. So warns British Summer Fruits, the industry body. Stand by for complaints about the price of strawberries and cream when Brexit angst hits Wimbledon. S IS FOR SABOTEURS Abusive term of choice in the Brextremist press to attack anyone with the temerity to mention the disadvantages of hard Brexit. Mrs May’s election gambit was hailed as an opportunity to “crush the saboteurs”. That went well, didn’t it? T IS FOR TRANSITIONAL ARRANGEMENT Regarded by the Treasury and many others as vital in order to minimise the economic disruption of Brexit, this would mean that Britain only slowly extricated itself from many aspects of the EU. Transitional arrangements can turn into permanent ones, which is why the notion is viewed with narrow-eyed suspicion by many hard Brexiters. U IS FOR UKIP The plum-and-custard brigade were obliterated at the election, but Ukip could revive on the back of voters angered by a diluted, delayed or ditched Brexit. Nigel Farage has hinted that he might be up for a third tour – or would that be fourth? V IS FOR VOTERS Bloody voters. The electorate is ultimately to blame for casting Britain adrift in an ocean of uncertainty. Voters narrowly chose to instruct politicians to take Britain out of the EU in the 2016 referendum. Then the country declined to give Mrs May a mandate to pursue her type of Brexit while producing a parliament without any clear consensus for any other version. Bloody voters. W IS FOR WORLD TRADE ORGANISATION In the event of Britain departing with no deal on trade, we would default to the rules set by the World Trade Organisation. Hard Brexiters argue that this would not be so terrible. Many businesses say it would mean a nightmare as tariffs and non-tariff barriers were erected between UK and EU trade. X IS FOR KISSES still being blown across the Channel from some on the continent. Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, recently voiced the hope that Britain might change its mind. The election result has emboldened some British Remainers to believe the battle is not over yet. Breversal would require a decisive shift in public opinion and a government willing to hold a second referendum and able to win it in order to overturn the result of the first. Y IS FOR YOUTH The pro-Remain young were overwhelmed by the pro-Leave old in the referendum. Many&nbsp;young voters have said that their anger animated them to seek their revenge on the Tories in the recent election. What goes around comes around. Z IS FOR ZERO HOUR That would be 29 March 2019, when the UK is scheduled to leave the EU, deal or no deal. If there is an agreement, it will need to be wrapped up by the end of 2018 to leave time for approval by EU states and the European parliament. An extension is possible, but would require the unanimous consent of the EU 27. Time is not Britain’s friend. So thank goodness we have such a strong and stable government.'},\n",

       "    'fields': {'bodyText': 'Jeremy Corbyn was under pressure from across the labour movement last night to support a softer form of Brexit as the TUC joined senior party figures in calling for Britain to retain the option of staying in the single market. The unions’ intervention followed a call from Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Brexit select committee, who wants the party leadership to shift position and support staying in the customs union rather than rejecting the possibility outright. Last week, 50 senior Labour MPs, peers and MEPs, including the former shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna, signed a statement saying the best way to respect the wishes of the pro-Remainers who voted for Labour on 8 June was to “fight unambiguously for membership of the single market”. Both Corbyn and the shadow chancellor John McDonnell have thus far stopped short of explicitly insisting upon membership of the single market and customs union, stressing instead that whatever deal is done must ensure that the UK continues to enjoy the full benefits of both. However, after the general election, there is a growing view in Labour, and sections of the Tory party, that the government lacks a mandate for a hard Brexit, and that such as an approach is not backed by a majority of MPs, who fear dire economic consequences of such a complete break. Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the TUC ,is known to back single market membership. She tweeted earlier this year: “If we leave the single market, working people will end up paying the price. It’d be bad for jobs, for work rights &amp; for our living standards.” On Saturday, a statement from the TUC said that Britain “needs a Brexit that works for working people” and insisted it was a “mistake” for Theresa May to rule out membership of the single market. “That risks people’s jobs and their hard-won rights at work. At the very least, the Brexit deal must allow tariff-free and barrier-free trade with Europe. And written into the deal there must be an ongoing level playing field on workers’ rights between the UK and the EU.” Labour MPs expect that unions such as the GMB may also pressure Corbyn to shift ground in the run up to the party conference in the autumn. With bills on Brexit dominating last week’s Queen’s speech, the battle over the terms of the UK withdrawal from the EU is about to begin in earnest in parliament. Increasingly, pro-EU MPs in both Labour and Tory ranks are urging their leaders to modify their positions to ensure the economic damage is as limited as possible. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme Benn said maintaining tariff-free trade was essential to the future of the British economy and urged Corbyn to move. “The simplest way to do that is to remain in the customs union,” he said. From the Tory side, the former minister Nicky Morgan – who is campaigning to become the chairwoman of the powerful Treasury select committee – said it was “very disappointing” that May had decided to “turn her back completely on the single market and the customs union”. She said there was a growing view across parliament that membership of the customs union, at least, had to be kept on the table in Brexit negotiations. An early test of cross-party cooperation among those MPs who are opposed to a hard Brexit will come this week when the Liberal Democrats put down an amendment to the Queen’s speech calling for Britain to stay in both the single market and customs union. The Lib Dems say they have opened talks with MPs from other parties. Alistair Carmichael, the party’s chief whip, said: “Many people, including those who voted Leave, are increasingly worried about what Brexit will mean for our economy and living standards. “We’re now staring over the precipice at the economic reality of an extreme Brexit. Future generations won’t forgive us if we fail to act.” On Sunday the government will pledge to keep duty-free access to UK markets for the world’s poorest 48 countries across the globe, including Bangladesh, Haiti, Ethiopia and Sierra Leone. They will continue to benefit from duty-free exports into the UK for all goods other than weapons, known as the “everything but arms” EU initiative.'},\n",
